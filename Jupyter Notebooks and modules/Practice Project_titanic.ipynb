    "## Introduction\n",
    "Now that you have a feel for how to optimize your machine learning pipeline, let's practice with a real world dataset.  \n",
    "You'll use cross validation and a hyperparameter grid search to optimize your machine learning pipeline.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will use the Titanic Survival Dataset to build a classification model to predict whether a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic, based on attributes of each passenger in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll start with building a Random Forest Classifier, then modify your pipeline to use a Logistic Regression estimator instead. You'll evaluate and compare your results.\n",

    " - Implement a pipeline to combine your preprocessing steps with a machine learning model\n",

    "Although the performances of the two models are virtually identical, the features that are important to the two models are very different. This suggests there must be more work to do to better grasp the actual feature importancdes. A smentioned above, it's crucially important to realize that there is most likely plenty of dependence amongst these variables, and a more detailed modelling approach including correlation analysis is required to draw proper conclusions. For example, there is significant information implied between the variables `who_man`, `who_woman`, and `who_child`, because if a person is neither a man nor a woman, then they must be a child.\n"
