# IBM-Capstone-Final-Project-
This repository contains my Capstone Project (IBM Data Science Specialisation) creating a presentation that summarizes my results of all tasks completed in the previous modules and labs. The project reports all data science workflows, data collections, EDA, visualisation, data wrangling, ML assignments using juypter notebook and dashboard development. The capstone project is all about the SpaceX Falcone 9 first stage langings.

# 2. Notebooks & Modules
- Data Wrangling: Cleaning and preparing SpaceX datasets.
- EDA with SQL: SQL queries for data exploration.
- EDA with Visualization: Data visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- Folium: Mapping launch sites and geospatial analysis.
- SpaceX API: Collecting launch data via API.
- Machine Learning: SpaceX-Machine-Learning-Prediction-Part-5-v1.ipynb — ML pipeline to predict first stage landing success.

# 3. Dashboard Application
An interactive dashboard is built using Plotly Dash (dashboard/app.py). It visualizes SpaceX launch records, success rates, and payload analysis.

# 4. Data sources & files
- SpaceX launch data (CSV files)
- SpaceX API
- Datasets provided by IBM Skills Network
  
# 5. Results & conclusions 
- Data Wrangling: Cleaned and merged datasets for analysis.
- EDA: Insights into launch patterns, site performance, and payload effects.
- Machine Learning: Built and evaluated models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees) to predict landing success.
- Dashboard: Interactive visualization of launch outcomes and payload analysis.
